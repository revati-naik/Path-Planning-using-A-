# Path-Planning-using-A_Star
Implement A* Algorithm to find the shortest path between start and endpoint.

# ENPM661_Proj3_Phase2
A* implementation for Rigid Robot

The two main files are A_Star_rigid.py

## Dependencies
Numpy
Matplotlib
Shapely
Heapq
time

## Instructions to run A* for a Rigid Robot
```python
$ git clone https://github.com/revati-naik/Path-Palnning-using-A_Star.git
$ python Codes/A_Star_rigid.py
```
The user will then be prompted for various inputs.
Once the program finishes, the optimal path to the goal is displayed. Consider the example below.

```
Enter starting coordinates (x y): 5 5 
Enter goal coordinates (x y): 295 195
Reached Goal!
Time to run A*: 4.436329 seconds
```

The file `a_star_rigid.mp4` shows the animation for the exploration of the search space and the final chosen optimal path.
